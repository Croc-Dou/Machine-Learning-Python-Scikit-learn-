# Machine-Learning

Predicting Continuous Target Variable with Regression
Simple/Multiple Linear Regression Model (OLS - SGD)
Exploratory Data Analysis
Robust Regression Model – RANdom SAmple Consensus (RANSAC)
Regularized Methods for Regression-L1 (LASSO), L2 (Ridge), and L1&L2 (ElasticNet)
Polynomial Regression
Decision Tree Regression / Random Forest Regression

Cluster Analysis
Group by similarity k-Means
Hard vs Soft Clustering
“Elbow Method”
Organizing Clusters as a hierarchical tree
Dendrograms and heat map
Density-based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN)

And some other practices.
